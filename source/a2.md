# A2-based phones
⚠️WARNING⚠️: You must first have a phone with BROWN certificates, otherwise you won't be able to mod your A2-based phone. You can do this with a tool such as [Omnius for SE](https://www.kaijousuru.com/) (Feel free to join the Discord to ask for an Omnius account)

## Flashing
### A2uploader
This tool is pretty straightforward, here's how you use it :

![A2Uploader Steps](_static/a2flasher_1.png)

1. Add both your `.mbn` and `.fbn` files
2. Add your customization pack (as a `.zip`)
3. Press flash


It should ask you to remove the battery, insert it back after 5 seconds and then inserting the USB cable while holding C. Once detected, the flashing process starts. When done, unplug the USB cable, remove the battery, insert it back after 5 seconds, start the phone and it should boot on the firmware you just flashed after a few progress bars.
